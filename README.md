# SR-for-Children
A song aiming to introduce young people to the unintuitive implications of Einstein's theory of special relativity.
Created as part of the assessment for my MPhys project at the University of Edinburgh. 

The flac file can be played from any reasonable music player, and the lyrics can be opened with your favourite text editor.

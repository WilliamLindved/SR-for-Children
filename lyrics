There are three dimensions, three directions which I can go
up down, left and right, I can even go back and forwards

It's easy this way
I know how to think about space
I see it every day

One two three,
x y z
now I know where I am


I'm going on a round trip to a neighbouring star
I know I will be back soon though I'm going very far

As Einstein put in ink
if I go fast the length will shrink
I'll be there in a wink

On time to any place
all I have to do is race
at furious pace


Going to visit Sirius, almost 10 light years away
but with incredible speed I can get there in less than a day

You know that sounds unreal, there must be more that's at play
it won't be much further than Pluto, I'll be back for lunch on Tuesday

How can that be?
Whether it really works remains to see
it's so bizarre if that's reality

As I set off I realise, the sun's yellow shine has turned red
its rays have sped up with me, I can never overtake them


Are you never coming home?
well I guess I'm slow and so
faster I must go

The sun I thought I knew
is turning frighteningly blue


I'm almost back at home, I've returned with great haste
I hope nothing much there has changed

I have been 20 years alone
How did you grow so old?
Your time was running slow
when speed of you took hold
I am really upset
how could you forget
that you can not neglect
time dilation effects


There is time and there is space
they're intertwined in ways
which may seem to be strange
but have to be embraced
it's never gonna change
it is the world that we must face
